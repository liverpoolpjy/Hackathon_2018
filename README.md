## The Mars Challenge

![Planet Mars](https://github.com/ghostplant/Hackathon_2018/blob/master/documentation/images/mars-11608_640.jpg)

Welcome to the Mars Challenge! You and your team are about to embark on a
space adventure that will challenge your **developer, operator, data analysis
and infrastructure** skills. The Challenge puts you in the arid lands of Mars:

*You and your team just landed on Mars. As you prepare your base of operations,
you receive word that massive Sun storms are coming your way. Now radio contact
with Earth has been lost. Your base has protective electromagnetic shields that
can protect you from the radiation, but can only be running for a few minutes
at a time without recharging.*

*Your only chance of survival is to monitor the current temperature and
radiation levels in the planet's atmosphere to detect solar flares and activate
your base shields for protection.*

*You only have a few hours to implement a sensor array, build and deploy the
monitoring application to engage/disengage your shields, then fine tune an
algorithm based on your data analysis that decides when to charge your shields
and when to engage them for protection. Will you and your team survive?*

You and your team will have at your disposal the necessary tools to survive and
win the challenge, however you will need all wits and skills to work together
and implement a solution that allows you to survive and outlast other teams.

**Available hardware and software resources for each team:**
- 1 x Raspberry Pi **per Team** to act as an atmospheric sensor
- 1 x VM in a cloud provider **per Team** to act as a container host
- Raspberry Pi and VM are pre-loaded with Docker

**Challenge Requirements:**
- Each Participant will need to bring their own Laptop/computer.
- Deployment of system layers needs to be implemented using containers.
- Deployment of the system needs to be automated using Deployment Tools.
- All data from sensors and services needs to be logged.
- All data needs be backed up on regular intervals.
- Team solutions need to connect to the Mars Challenge [Game Controller](https://github.com/ghostplant/Hackathon_2018/tree/master/game-controller)

**What should you accomplish from participating on this Hackathon?**

This Hackathon will challenge you to accomplish the following:

- Build and deploy a modern distributed application using best practices.
- Deploy a distributed application using containers.
- Practice container configuration, execution and debugging.
- Deploy a distributed application using modern deployment technologies like
  Docker Swarm, Compose, Mesos, or Kubernetes).
- Develop an application on the Internet of Things (IoT) space.
